# Weather_Dashboard
This assignment displays the weather for the current day and a 5 day forecast. The site utilizes a weather API that provides information for various aspects of the weather such as the whether there is sun, rain, or snow, the wind speed, the humidity and the UV index. When the user searches for any city the latitude and longitude in the API is fetched using Jquery to provide the user with the right information for the specific city they searched. Once the city is searched, the correct information is plotted in the corresponding information titles on the cards. The largest card near the top of the webpage displays the current day, and underneath there is the next 5 days contained in smaller cards.




Overall this project was very informative in teaching the proper use of API technologies and how they can be applied to a site.Â 

Thank you
